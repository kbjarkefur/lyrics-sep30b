It's life, it's life, it's life
It's life, it's life, it's life
It's life, it's life, it's life
Happiness, more or less
It's just a change in me, something in my liberty
Oh, my, my
Happiness, coming and going
I watch you look at me, and watch my fever grow
And I know just where I am
But how many corners do I have to turn?
How many times do I have to learn
All the love I have is in my mind?
But I'm a lucky man
With fire in my hands
Happiness, something in my own place
I'm stood here naked, I smile and I feel no disgrace
With who I am
Happiness, coming and going
I watch you look at me, watch my fever grow
And I know just who I am
And how many corners do I have to turn?
How many times do I have to learn
All the love I have is in my mind?
I hope you understand
I hope you understand
Oh yeah
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
Got a love that'll never die, no, no (you know, you know)
Happiness more or less
It's just a change in me, something in my liberty
Happiness, coming and going
I watch you look at me, watch my fever grow
And I know
Oh, my, my
Oh, my, my
Oh, my, my
Oh, my, my, my, my, my
We got a love that never dies
I got a love that'll never die
No, no
And I love you, man
Yeah
It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty (don't think, don't, don't think I'm lying)
It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty (don't think, don't think I'm lying, I'm trying)
It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty
Oh, my, my
Oh, my, my
It's just a change in me, something in my liberty
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I said oh, my, my, my, my, my
